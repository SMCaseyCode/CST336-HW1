Difficulties faced: <br>
- Manipulating content in divs
- Utilizing flexbox efficiently
- Planning structure to reduce redundancy
- Aesthetic Design

What I Learned: <br>
- The value of drawing out a design ahead of time
- How you can use flexbox on a container div, then also use it on another div inside
- `text-shadow` can be used to make text pop
- How to write `padding/margin` values in one line
- The value of creating a template for a page which can be used on another
- How `rem` and `em` work
- That `vh` and `vw` are referring to the `viewport` and are not able to scale well
